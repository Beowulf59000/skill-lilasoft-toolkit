'LilaSoft' Skill Toolkit is a simple toolkit to develop fast skills combined with Alexa Skill Toolkit. 

> This project is in "alpha" state, which mean it was developed for my personal purposes and I still need to use it a lot more and fix it (e.g. test coverages). Do not use for your production skills until this project is in stable version.

## Features
* TypeScript compatibility
* Fast creation of Request Handler
* Fast creation of Intent Handler
* MessagesHelper : Gives each time several messages to the speaker, the toolkit will select one message to say : Alexa will be fore 'human' if you give it more variations of sentences to say
* SpeakersHelper : It can be boring to add each time same methods to our responseBuilder to hear messages, reprompts or display cards. One method can combine them in a black box

## Getting Started
